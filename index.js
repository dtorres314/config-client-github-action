 * This action does a number of things for us:
 *
 * 1. It loads environment variables from Spring Cloud Config Server and loads them into the Github Actions workflow environment
 * 2. It also determines which environment we're in - `PRODUCTION` or `DEVELOPMENT` and exports that as an environment variable, `BP_MODE_LOWERCASE`.
